This React project focuses on implementing a parser that converts mathematical expressions written in infix notation to postfix notation. Infix notation is the commonly used mathematical notation where operators are placed between operands, such as 2 + 3 * 4. Postfix notation, also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), represents the same expression as 2 3 4 * +.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input infix expressions and obtain their equivalent postfix representations. By parsing and converting infix expressions to postfix notation, users can benefit from the simplicity and efficiency of postfix notation when evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Getting started 
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/DawidZyluk/infix-to-postfix-parser.git
  cd infix-to-postfix-parser
  npm install
  npm run dev
```
## Usage
The application provides a simple user interface where users can enter infix expressions into an input field. Upon submission, the parser will convert the infix expression to postfix notation and display the result. Users can experiment with different expressions and observe the corresponding postfix representations.

## Features
Converts infix mathematical expressions to postfix notation.
Supports various operators, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses.
Provides real-time conversion as users input their expressions.
User-friendly interface with instant results.
